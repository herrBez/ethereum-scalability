\subsection{Propagation Layer}
\label{sec:propagation-layer}

The propagation layer's objective is to spread the information regarding the
blockchain among all the peers. It exploits the contact information obtained in
the network layer.

In this layer, we can identify three main components used to pursue this aim:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{RLP}, the main encoding method used to serialize objects in
  Ethereum
  \item the RLPx protocol, intended as the transport
  protocol\footnote{\url{https://github.com/ethereum/devp2p/blob/master/rlpx.md\#transport}},
  which plays a role very similar to the OSI transport layer. For the sake of
  disambiguation, we refer to it as \emph{RLPx Transport Protocol}
  \item the \emph{Ethereum Wire Protocol}, useful to spread the blockchain
  information.
\end{itemize}
