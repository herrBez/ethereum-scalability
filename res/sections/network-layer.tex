\subsection{Network layer}
\label{sec:network-layer}

The aim of this layer is to build the peer-to-peer network, a decentralized
architecture in which the nodes are logically equivalent and function as a
\emph{servent} (i.e. a node that acts as both client and server at the same
time). In this type of architecture, the nodes are formed by processes and the
links represent the possible communication channels, that is, a
\textbf{structured overlay network} \cite{van2017distributed} in which the nodes
of the network can propagate the information efficiently. Essentially, this
layer is constituted by a slight modification of the Kademlia protocol
\cite{bib:kademlia}. In the Ethereum jargon, this protocol is known as
\emph{RLPx Node Discovery Protocol}~\cite{bib:rlpx-discovery-protocol}. In the
remainder of this Section, we firstly describe Kademlia and afterward the
Ethereum variant.


\subsubsection{Kademlia protocol}
The Kademlia protocol is an UDP based distributed hash table (DHT) system based
on the XOR-metric for distance \cite{bib:kademlia}, that is the distance between
two keys $x$ and $y$ is given by $x \otimes y$. The nodes have a unique $m$-bit
(e.g. $160$) identifier (ID) and are \emph{logically} the leaves of a binary
tree of size $2^m$. The identifier of a node corresponds to the path from the
root of this tree to the position of the node.

Each node in the network maintains $m$ lists, which contain the contact
information of the peers at a given XOR-distance from the node. In particular,
the $i$-th list of a given node contains information regarding nodes at distance
between $2^i$ and $2^{i+1}$ from it's ID. The maximal capacity of these lists,
$k$, is chosen to minimize the probability that all the nodes in the lists fail
at the same time. This parameter is  known as \emph{system-wide replication
parameter}. Because of their maximal capacity the lists are usually denoted by
the term \emph{k-bucket}.

\begin{algorithm}[t]
    \begin{algorithmic}
        \State $distance$ $\gets$ $S_{ID}$ $\otimes$ $R_{ID}$
        \State $bucket$ $\gets$ bucket containing nodes at the given distance
        \If {$S_{ID} \in bucket$}
        \State move $S_{ID}$ to the end of $bucket$
        \Else
        \If {$bucket$ not full}
        \State insert $S_{ID}$ at the end of the list
        \Else
        \State $H \gets head(bucket)$
        \State ping $H$
        \If {$H$ replies}
        \State move $H$ to the end of the list and discard $S$
        \Else
        \State evict $H$ and put $S_{ID}$ at the end of the list
        \EndIf
        \EndIf
        \EndIf
    \end{algorithmic}
    \caption{Pseudocode algorithm to update a bucket upon receiving a message
    from a node. The sender and the receiver are denoted by the letters $S$ and
    $R$, respectively.}
    \label{alg:kademlia:update}
\end{algorithm}

Each bucket is maintained sorted: at the head we find the least recently seen
node and at the tail the most recently one. When a node receives a message from
a sender, it uses the Algorithm \autoref{alg:kademlia:update} to update the
contact table. One important feature of this algorithm is that, when the node
discovers a new node, the latter is added only if one of the already known peers
at the same distance is no more on-line. The rationale for this choice is due to
the observation that the more a node has been on-line, the more likely it is
that it remains up another hour~\cite{bib:kademlia}.

The basic operation of this system is the \emph{key lookup}. It is implemented
by asking recursively for closer and closer nodes. A node selects the $\alpha$
peers closest to the searched key. This operation is efficient because it
restricts the selection to the peers contained in the bucket in which the node
would have inserted the searched key\footnote{It is possible that the $k$-bucket
has less than $\alpha$ entries, in this case the node search also in other
buckets.}. Afterward, the node sends \emph{asynchronous} requests to these
peers, that should reply with the contact information of the $k$ closest nodes
it knows. From the replied values the node takes only the closest $\alpha$ ones.
The algorithm performs this step recursively. If in one of the phases no new
closer nodes are discovered, the node retries with the $k$ closest discovered
nodes.

The lookup is fundamental to perform the task of storing a $\langle key,
value\rangle$ pair in the DHT, retrieving a resource from the DHT and get the
contact information of a searched peer. To perform the lookup and manage the
DHT, the Kademlia protocol relies on only four RPC functions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \verb|PING| is used to check whether a node is still on-line or not
    \item \verb|FIND_NODE| requests the replier to respond with the contact
    information of the $k$ peers closest to the target
    \item \verb|STORE| requests the receiver to store the given key-value pair
    \item \verb|FIND_VALUE| requests the receiver to reply with the $k$ nodes
    closest to the source. If the receiver has previously stored the key-value
    pair, it replies with the searched value.
\end{itemize}


\paragraph{Difference between RLPx node discovery and Kademlia}
\label{sec:rlpx-discovery}
The RLPx node discovery protocol is used only for discovery, so \verb|STORE| and
\verb|FIND_VALUE| RPC functions are not needed. Each node is assigned to a $512$
bit long ID and the XOR distance is calculated on the Keccak-256 hash of the
IDs. Therefore, \emph{conceptually} each node stores $256$
$k$-buckets\footnote{We provide only a general overview of the algorithm. For
implementation optimizations we refer to ~\cite{bib:kademlia}.}. The replication
parameter, $k$, is set to $16$ and the concurrency parameter, $\alpha$, is set
to $3$~\cite{bib:rlpx-discovery-protocol}.

\subparagraph{Packet Format}
The nodes communicate through UDP packets in which the payload is used to encode
the messages of the Ethereum's network layer. Inside the UDP payload, the nodes
should insert:
\begin{itemize}
    \item the hash of the juxtaposition of signature, packet-type and
    packet-data, used to verify the integrity of the UDP datagram
    \item the signature, used to check the identity of the sender and can be
    verified through the node ID, which is the public key
    \item the packet-type, that is a byte that uniquely identify the packet
    type: \texttt{Ping} (0x01), \texttt{Pong} (0x02), \texttt{FindNeighbours}
    (0x03) and \texttt{Neighbours} (0x04)~\cite{bib:rlpx-discovery-protocol}
    \item the packet-data, that has a different format depending on the packet
    type and is encoded with the RLP algorithm (\autoref{sec:marshaling}). We
    refer to~\cite{bib:rlpx-discovery-protocol} for the exact content exchanged
    with the different RLPx node discovery packets.
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}

The packet format is illustrated in~\autoref{fig:rlpx-node-discovery}.


\subparagraph{Joining the network}
In order to join the network for the first time, a new node should generate a
new public-private key pair\footnote{The public key is the ID and the private
key is used to sign the packets.} and know the contact of at least one
participant. In Ethereum, this task is accomplished by hard-coding the contact
information of some \textit{bootstrap nodes} in the client's code. The aim of
these nodes is to provide new nodes with contact information to other regular
nodes that are already participating in the network.

RLPx uses its own URL scheme, the \emph{enode}. In this scheme, the ID of the
node encoded in hexadecimal format, the IP-Address and the TCP Port of the node
are specified:
\begin{verbatim}
enode://<hexadecimal-node-id>@<IP>:<TCP-Port>[?discport:<UDP-PORT>]
\end{verbatim}
The \verb|discport| part is required only if the UDP port (discovery port) does
not correspond to the TCP one. The default UDP discovery port is 30303.
