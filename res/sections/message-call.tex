\subsubsection{Message Call}
The message call is the mean to invoke a contract code and can be either
triggered by a transaction or by the execution of a contract.
A message call takes as input a state and the message itself (the data field)
and returns an output, that is from the point of view of Ethereum only 
relevant if the message call is triggered by an execution.

The first step in the message call algorithm is the transfer of value from the
sender account to the receiver one. If the recipient of the message is
an externally owned account, the message call terminates, otherwise the contract
of the account is executed on the EVM. 
If during this execution an error occurred (e.g. stack overflow/underflow,
out of gas exception) the gas is not refunded and the state is reverted 
to the state prior to the execution. This means that the sender
looses the gas but recovers the sent value. If the execution succeed this state
persists.
