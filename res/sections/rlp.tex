\subsubsection{Serialization Algorithm}
\label{sec:marshaling}

The Recursive Length Prefix (RLP) encoding algorithm is a fundamental building
block in the Ethereum system. It is used both to serialize the content of the
UDP and TCP packets sent as described in~\autoref{sec:network-layer}
and~\autoref{sec:rlpx-transport-protocol}, and to reach a bit level consensus on
the World State through the blockchain as described
in~\autoref{sec:world-state}.

This algorithm is \emph{only} used to encode byte arrays of arbitrary length. It
does neither try to deal with types nor considering signed integers and floating
numbers~\cite{wood2018ethereum}. The interpretation of the values is completely
dependent on the message in the protocol, which should also specify the
byte-size of the structures involved. According to the
documentation~\cite{bib:design-rationale}, RLP has been chosen for its
simplicity and its byte level consistency. For the formal specification of the
algorithm, we refer to the Yellow Paper~\cite[Appendix B]{wood2018ethereum} and
the RLP documentation~\cite{bib:ethereumrlpspec}.
